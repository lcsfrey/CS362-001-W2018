Bug Report 1:
 Bug 1: 
  Appt.java
    -isValid function does not mark an Appt as inValid 
     if the startHour is an invalid hour (e.g. startHour < 1 or startHour > 24)

 Bug 2:
  TimeTable.java 
    -Line 108: getApptOccurences function does not add any appointments to a 
               CalDay object if that Appt does not recur. If it does recur, 
               it adds occurences equal to one less than recurNumber
